Repository Structure
- server/
  - index.js: Node.js Express server implementing the required endpoints and connecting to Firestore (Datastore mode) via @google-cloud/datastore.
  - package.json / package-lock.json: Node dependencies and scripts.
- client/
  - analysis.py: Client-side script (run locally) that measures latency and performs the eventual consistency experiment.
- Team_HW2.txt: netID
- IPs.txt: external IPs of both cloud instances (space-separated)
- Code_HW2.txt: this file
- Analysis.txt: latency results, eventual consistency misses, and discussion

Server Implementation (server/index.js)
- Runs an Express server listening on 0.0.0.0:8080.
- Endpoints:
  1) GET /greeting
     - Returns a simple “Hello World!” webpage (HTML).
  2) POST /register
     - Accepts JSON body: {"username": "<string>"}.
     - Creates/overwrites an entity in Firestore (Datastore mode) using kind "User".
     - The entity key is the username (primary key). Stored properties include:
       - username (string)
       - createdAt (timestamp/ISO string, optional)
  3) GET /list
     - Queries all entities of kind "User".
     - Returns JSON: {"users": ["u1", "u2", ...]} (ordering not assumed).
  4) POST /clear
     - Deletes all entities of kind "User" (batched deletes to avoid limits).
     - Returns JSON confirmation.

Cloud Deployment
- Instance A (us-central1): 34.68.248.167
- Instance B (europe-west1): 34.78.178.238
- Both instances run the same server code and connect to the same Firestore database in Datastore mode (same GCP project).
- No manual replication code is used; GCP handles cross-region replication automatically. Updates made on one instance become visible on the other (eventual consistency).

Analysis Script (client/analysis.py)
- Part IV-A: Sends at least 10 requests to /register and /list on each instance and reports average latency (ms).
- Part IV-B: Repeats 100 iterations; each iteration registers a unique username in one region (US) and immediately lists from the other region (EU), counting how many times the new username is not found (“misses”).
- Output is copied into Analysis.txt.
